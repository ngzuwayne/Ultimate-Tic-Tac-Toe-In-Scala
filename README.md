# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe in Scala

This was a university project I completed in my second year, circa August 2024. 

This was done specifically in ScalaFX and Scene Builder.

Ultimate tic-tac-toe consists of nine independant tic-tac-toe boards on a 3x3 grid. 

However, where you place your mark determines where your opponent places their next mark. 

I brought this over from a private repository under my university onto this public repository I created for myself. 

I decided to do this after an interview I had for my internship.
