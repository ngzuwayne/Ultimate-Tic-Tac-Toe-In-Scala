# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe in Scala

This was a university project I completed in my second year, circa August 2024. 

Ultimate tic tac toe consists of nine independant tic tac toe boards on another 3x3 grid. 

However, where you place your mark determines where your opponent places their next mark. 

I have a YouTube video, addressed to my lecturer, explaining my program: https://youtu.be/2XCmaEIh5Hg 

I brought this over from a private repository under my university onto this public repository I created for myself. 

I decided to do this after an interview I had for my internship.
